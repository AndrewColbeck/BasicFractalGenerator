# Basic_Fractal_Generator
Written in C++ with Swingame SDK, this Program uses a simple recursive function to draw fractal-like structures on the user's screen.

This Program builds on code provided by Dr. Prince Kurumthodathu Surendran, and in this version, recursion has been capped (nothing can have a radius of less than 8 pixels) to suit standard computer monitors.

Future development will hopefully entail porting the Program to a 3D environment.<br><br>
