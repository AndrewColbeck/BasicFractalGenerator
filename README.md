# Basic_Fractal_Generator
Written in C++ with Swingame SDK, this Program uses a simple recursive function to draw a Fractal-like structure on the user's screen.

This Program builds on code provided by Dr. Prince Kurumthodathu Surendran, and although it does not currently generate truly recursive Fractals, can be easily modified
